Producer-Consumer-Application
A multi-threaded Java app simulating a classic producer-consumer scenario using a shared, thread-safe message queue. Producers generate messages, and consumers process them, with logging for successful and failed messages. Built with Java 11, Maven, and JUnit 5, this project is ideal for learning concurrency, synchronization, and unit testing.
